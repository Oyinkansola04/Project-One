                <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>

                <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that i thought that i loved, but the truth was i couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>
                <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that i hated, a home that i didn't want to live in, and i couldn't hold a relationship.</p>

                <h3>> How i turned things around</h3>
                <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when i got rid of everything</strong>. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and i quit my job.</p>
                <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>

                <h3>> Now i live the simple life</h3>
                <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and i have more free time to enjoy.</p>
                <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>i felt like i had no choice but to start sharing how i did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why i started this site!</p>
